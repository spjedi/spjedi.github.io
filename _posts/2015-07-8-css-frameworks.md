CSS Frameworks seem like an awesome advancement at first glance: speed up your development, normalize your code base, and eliminate those nasty browser bugs!  Hot damn, where do I sign up?  Unfortunately there's some pretty strong caveats that go with those statements.

## The frameworks themselves are very good

I'd like to start this off by saying there's nothing inheritly wrong with any of the CSS, HTML, or ideas put into these frameworks.  I also think it's an absolutely fabulous idea that people are writing them -- it gives newcomers an easy way out to create professional looking designs using semantic XHTML and CSS.

* Familiarity with your code's architecture
* Inheriting someone else's bugs
* Not learning
